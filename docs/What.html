                                            Mantas can be found across the Hawaiian islands. On the island of Oahu, one
                                            hot spot for them is Kāne'ohe Bay, a large sheltered bay off the eastern
                                            shore. <text class="special">The waters of Kāne'ohe Bay have lots of
                                                nutrients, which provides abundant plankton for mantas</text> but also
                                            causes water visibility to be very poor.

                                            <text class="special">Unfortunately, very little is known about the mantas
                                                that inhabit Kāne'ohe Bay</text>. They have been observed feeding in
                                            groups of up to nine individuals. When the group encounters an area rich in
                                            plankton, they rotate around the area to concentrate the plankton, then
                                            swoop in to feast. This is thought to be a more efficient way to feed than
                                            acting individually.

                                                distribution and abundance of mantas in Kāne'ohe Bay</text>. A drone and
                                            paddleboard were used to survey a portion of the bay, and all mantas
                                            encountered were recorded. This provided data on the location and group size
                                            of mantas, as well as several environmental factors that could affect the
                                            behavior of mantas. Photos of the mantas, both from air and in water, were
                                            taken for later reference.
