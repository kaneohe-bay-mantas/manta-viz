                                            Reef manta rays are large filter feeders that are found in coastal waters across the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. Though they are closely related to sharks and can grow to a massive wingspan of 15 feet, mantas only eat plankton and small fish. They take in large volumes of water through their massive mouths, and filter the water through their gills to sieve out these small organisms.

                                            Mantas can be found across the Hawaiian islands. On the island of Oahu, one hot spot for them is Kaneohe Bay, a large sheltered bay off the eastern shore. The waters of Kaneohe Bay have lots of nutrients, which provides abundant plankton for mantas but also causes water visibility to be very poor.

                                            Unfortunately, very little is known about the mantas that inhabit Kaneohe Bay. They have been observed feeding in groups of up to nine individuals. When the group encounters an area rich in plankton, they rotate around the area to concentrate the plankton, then swoop in to feast. This is thought to be a more efficient way to feed than acting individually.

                                            A simple study was carried out to learn more about the distribution and abundance of mantas in Kaneohe Bay. A drone and paddleboard were used to survey a portion of the bay, and all mantas encountered were recorded. This provided data on the location and group size of mantas, as well as several environmental factors that could affect the behavior of mantas. Photos of the mantas, both from air and in water, were taken for later reference.
